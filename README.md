# Hello! 

My education in digital audio drew me into voice-recognition software and video production. I am currently enrolled at [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com/what-to-expect), developing my skills in JavaScript, React, C#, .NET, and much more. 

I love nature recording, film photography, and collaboration.
